# Security Fixes Documentation

## Secrets Found and Removed
1. Removed hardcoded AWS Secret Key from secrets.txt
2. Removed hardcoded DB_PASSWORD from index.js and replaced with environment variable

## Dependency Updates
1. Updated Express from 4.17.1 to 4.18.2
2. Updated Node.js from v12 to v18 (LTS)
3. Added engines field to package.json to enforce Node.js version

## Docker Security Improvements
1. Updated base image from node:12-alpine to node:18-alpine
2. Implemented multi-stage build to reduce final image size
3. Added non-root user for container security
4. Using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for deterministic builds

## Security Tools Integrated
1. Gitleaks for secret scanning
   - Configured to detect AWS keys and generic API keys
   - Added allowlist for documentation files
2. Trivy for container scanning
   - Scanning for OS and library vulnerabilities
   - Configured to fail on CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues
3. npm audit for dependency scanning
   - Running in CI pipeline
   - Production dependencies only

## CI Pipeline Improvements
1. Added security job that runs before build
2. Implemented proper dependency installation with `npm ci`
3. Added container scanning step
4. Added dependency audit step
5. Improved Node.js setup with latest LTS version

## Additional Security Measures
1. Implemented proper environment variable usage
2. Added security-focused documentation
3. Improved Docker security with non-root user
4. Added proper error handling and logging
